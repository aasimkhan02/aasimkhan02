💫 About Me:
👋 Hi, I’m Aasim Khan — a passionate developer focused on building intelligent and impactful systems.

🔭 I’m currently working with IOOS on the phytoClass package as part of Google Summer of Code 2025, contributing to scientific tooling for oceanographic data.

🤝 I’m looking to collaborate on open-source tools, AI integrations, and full-stack applications that solve real-world problems.

🌱 I’m currently learning more about machine learning, AI, and cloud technologies.

💬 Ask me about Python, REST APIs, React, or anything related to system architecture — I love breaking down complex problems.

💡 Fun fact: I built my first full-stack project before I even formally learned frontend — out of pure curiosity and a lot of Stack Overflow!
